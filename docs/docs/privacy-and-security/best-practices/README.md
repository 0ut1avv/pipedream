# Security Best Practices

Pipedream implements a range of [privacy and security measures](/privacy-and-security/) meant to protect your data from unauthorized access. Since Pipedream [workflows](/workflows), [event sources](/event-sources), and other resources can run any Node.js code and process any event data, it's your responsibility to ensure you handle that code and data securely. Below, we've outlined a handful of those best practices.

## Keep your workflow private

## Share your workflow only with trusted collaborators

## Store secrets as Pipedream connected accounts or environment variables

## Deliver data to Pipedream securely

## Send data out of Pipedream securely

## Add authentication to incoming event data

## Validate signatures for incoming events, where available

## Audit any code or packages you use within a workflow

## Limit what you log and return from steps

## Optionally encrypt incoming data before delivering it to Pipedream
