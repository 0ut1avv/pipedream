# Overview

## What is Pipedream?

Pipedream is a serverless platform to connect APIs at scale, remarkably fast. 

1. Connect OAuth and key-based API accounts in seconds.
2. Use connected accounts in Node.js code steps or no-code building blocks.
3. Build and run workflows triggered on HTTP requests, schedules, app events and more.

<!--Pipedream also makes it easy to test and validate your integrations, scaffold API requests for any app, maintain state between executions, manage execution rate and concurrency and more. -->

<!--With Pipedream, you can stop writing boilerplate code, struggling with authentication and managing infrastructure, and start connecting APIs with code-level control when you need it — and no code when you don't. -->

## How Pipedream Works

Pipedream provides a serverless platform to build and run workflows that connect APIs:

- Connect your OAuth and key-based API accounts in seconds
- Use connected accounts to auth APIs in code steps or in "no code" building blocks
- Compose steps into workflows and trigger on HTTP requests, schedules or app events

Pipedream also provides easy to use services to solve common serverless and integration challenges including state management, execution rate and concurrency controls, large file support (up to 5TB) and more!

## Is Pipedream for me?

If you or your team work with APIs and don't want to write boilerplate code, struggle with authentication and manage infrastructure, then Pipedream is for you. We make it easy to connect APIs with code-level control when you need it — and no code when you don't. 

Developers with a working knowledge of Node.js or Javascript will get the most value from Pipedream (Python, Typescript. and GitHub integration are coming soon).

Pipedream is trusted by 150k+ developers from startups to Fortune 500 companies:

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with our [quickstart guide](/quickstart/)
 
Learn the basic patterns to develop workflows:

- Trigger workflows on HTTP requests, schedules and app events
- Return a custom response from your workflow on HTTP requests 
- Use connected accounts in actions and code steps
- Pass data between code steps and no code actions
- Use npm packages in Node.js code steps
- Scaffold an API request in Node.js
- End workflow execution early

Pipedream offers a generous free tier (no credit card required) so you can test out the platform and use it for personal projects with no risk or committment. As your needs grow, it's easy to upgrade to paid plans to run without limits for individuals, teams and enterprises.

The platform processes billions of events and is built and [priced](https://pipedream.com/pricing/) to use at scale. [Our team](https://pipedream.com/about) has built internet scale applications and managed data pipelines in excess of 10 million events per second (EPS) at startups and high-growth environments like BrightRoll, Yahoo!, Affirm and Instacart. 

Our community uses Pipedream for a wide variety of use cases.

- API orchestration and automation
- Database automations (learn about [connecting to resources behind a firewall](/workflows/steps/code/nodejs/http-requests/#use-an-http-proxy-to-proxy-requests-through-another-host))
- Connecting SaaS apps
- Notification management
- Rate limiting, request smoothing
- Event queuing and concurrency management
- Mobile and JAMstack backends
- Webhook inspection and routing
- Prototyping and demos

## Open Source

Pipedream maintains an open source registry of source and action components on GitHub. Re-use these components in workflows so you don't need to write boilerplate code for common API integrations. Use existing components as scaffolding to customize and publish your own. Or create a PR contribute new or enhanced components via GitHub.

## Contributing

Our hope is that by providing a generous free tier, you will not only get value from Pipedream, but you will give back to help us improve the product for the entire community and grow the platform including:

- Contributing open source components to our registry or sharing via your own Github repo
- Ask and answer questions in our [public community](https://pipedream.com/community/)
- Report bugs and request features that will help us build a better product
- Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pipedream), star our [Github repo](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream) and subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/pipedreamhq)
- Recommend us to your friends and colleagues

### Benefits

### No servers or infrastructure to manage

In other tools, you typically have to setup infrastructure to process events — typically you setup an HTTP endpoint, then run a script on a container, or have to manage a serverless function. This takes time to write and maintain.

Pipedream is purpose-built for running workflows on event data, so we take care of the infrastructure and boilerplate configuration for you. **Pipedream lets you focus on _what_ you want done, and we take care of _how_ to do it for you.**

### Run any Node code

Write Node.js [code](/workflows/steps/code/) and require npm packages. `event` contains your trigger event data. Exported step data, along with standard output, appears under each code step for inline observability.

### Iterate quickly with inline observability, automatic versioning and instant deploys

See events and debug execution details in real time. Output, errors, timing, and return values appear below each step. Time travel to previous versions of code, at the time the event occurred.

### Connect to APIs without writing any code

[Actions](/workflows/steps/actions/) are pre-defined code steps built by the Pipedream community. Send a message to Slack or Discord, store data in S3 or Snowflake, and more, all without writing any code.

### Auth made easy

Auth apps once, connect to those apps in any workflow. Pipedream supports OAuth and key-based auth, and handles the OAuth flow and token refresh for you. Just link accounts to steps and reference the relevant auth info in code.

### It's free

The Pipedream team believes anyone should be able to run simple, low-volume workflows at no cost. **Pipedream offers a [generous free tier](/pricing/#developer-tier)**. You can run sources and workflows for free within the limits of the free tier. If you hit these limits, you can upgrade to one of our [paid tiers](/pricing/#professional-tier).
