# Overview

## What is Pipedream?

Pipedream is a low code platform to connect APIs, remarkably fast. 

1. Connect your OAuth and key-based API accounts in seconds.
2. Use connected accounts to authenticate APIs in Node.js code steps or no-code building blocks.
3. Compose steps into workflows triggered on HTTP requests, schedules, app events and more.

Pipedream also simplifies common integration challenges including inpection and debugging, state management, execution rate and concurrency management, secure sharing of credentials and more!

With Pipedream, you can stop writing boilerplate code, struggling with authentication and managing infrastructure, and start connecting APIs with code-level control when you need it — and no code when you don't. Watch a demo (4 min):

## How Pipedream Works

Pipedream provides a serverless platform to build and run workflows that connect APIs:

- Connect your OAuth and key-based API accounts in seconds
- Use connected accounts to auth APIs in code steps or in "no code" building blocks
- Compose steps into workflows and trigger on HTTP requests, schedules or app events

Pipedream also provides easy to use services to solve common serverless and integration challenges including state management, execution rate and concurrency controls, large file support (up to 5TB) and more!

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with our quickstart to learn the basic patterns to develop Pipedream workflows, including how to:

- Trigger workflows on HTTP requests, schedules and app events
- Return a custom response from your workflow on HTTP requests 
- Use actions to send yourself an email, add data to Google Sheets and send a message to Slack
- Use npm packages, data exports, and connected accounts in Node.js code steps
- Pass data between workflow steps

## Integrations

Hundreds of apps are already integrated with Pipedream. Explore APIs, triggers, actions and more in the [marketplace](https://pipedream.com/explore).

### Benefits

### No servers or infrastructure to manage

In other tools, you typically have to setup infrastructure to process events — typically you setup an HTTP endpoint, then run a script on a container, or have to manage a serverless function. This takes time to write and maintain.

Pipedream is purpose-built for running workflows on event data, so we take care of the infrastructure and boilerplate configuration for you. **Pipedream lets you focus on _what_ you want done, and we take care of _how_ to do it for you.**

### Run any Node code

Write Node.js [code](/workflows/steps/code/) and require npm packages. `event` contains your trigger event data. Exported step data, along with standard output, appears under each code step for inline observability.

### Iterate quickly with inline observability, automatic versioning and instant deploys

See events and debug execution details in real time. Output, errors, timing, and return values appear below each step. Time travel to previous versions of code, at the time the event occurred.

### Connect to APIs without writing any code

[Actions](/workflows/steps/actions/) are pre-defined code steps built by the Pipedream community. Send a message to Slack or Discord, store data in S3 or Snowflake, and more, all without writing any code.

### Auth made easy

Auth apps once, connect to those apps in any workflow. Pipedream supports OAuth and key-based auth, and handles the OAuth flow and token refresh for you. Just link accounts to steps and reference the relevant auth info in code.

### It's free

The Pipedream team believes anyone should be able to run simple, low-volume workflows at no cost. **Pipedream offers a [generous free tier](/pricing/#developer-tier)**. You can run sources and workflows for free within the limits of the free tier. If you hit these limits, you can upgrade to one of our [paid tiers](/pricing/#professional-tier).
