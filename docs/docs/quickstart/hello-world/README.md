# hello world!

In this first example, we'll create an HTTP triggered workflow and return a custom response of `hello world!` on each HTTP request. In order to do that, we'll:

1. Create a new workflow and learn about the builder layout
2. Generate a unique endpoint URL to trigger the workflow
3. Send HTTP requests to the workflow and inspect them
4. Add a custom response to return "hello world!" on each HTTP request

First, create a new workflow by clicking the **New** button from [https://pipedream.com/workflows:](https://pipedream.com/workflows)

Pipedream will launch the workfow builder:

Following is an brief overview of the screen layout:

![image-20210518181827110](../images/image-20210518181827110.png)

To create an HTTP or webhook triggered workflow, select the **HTTP API** trigger.

Your workflow will automatically deploy and Pipedream will generate a unique endpiont URL.

Any requests you make to the endpoint URL will trigger your workflow. To test it out:

1. Copy the endpoint URL generated by Pipedream (you can click to link icon to the right of the endpoint to copy to the clipboard)
2. Open a new browser tab and load the URL

![image-20210516194004679](../images/image-20210516194004679.png)

When you return to your workflow, you'll see the requests appear in the event list (events appear in real-time — you don't need to refresh the page). 

::: tip
You may see multiple events appear in the event list each time you load the endpoint URL in a web browsers's address bar. That happens because modern browsers automatically request `favicon.ico` when you load a URL.

When you select an event from the list, the data associated with that event will appear below each of the steps in your workflow. For the trigger, that means details related to the inbound request (e.g., the URL, method, body, headers, query parameters) can be inspected. This data can also be referenced by steps in your workflow via the `steps` object. For example, to reference the HTTP body, you would reference `steps.trigger.event.body`.

Next, let's write some simple code to return a custom response using Pipedream's `$respond()` function. First, click on **Run Node.js code** to add a code step (if the step selection menu is not expanded, click the **+** button below the trigger step).

Pipedream will add a code step to your workflow. 

![image-20210516194534525](../images/image-20210516194534525.png)

You can write any Node.js and include any npm package, but we'll cover that in a later part of this gide. For this example, just add the following code to return a custom response of `hello world!`:

```javascript
await $respond({
  status: 200,
  immediate: true,
  body: "hello world!"
})
```

Then click the **Deploy** button so your changes will run when your workflow is triggered by a new event.

The deploy should complete in about 1-2 seconds. Then reload the endpoint URL in your browser — you the response should change to `hello world!`.

Congratulations! You just built your first serverless workflow! 

**Next, let's pass data in the HTTP request and use it to customize the workflow response. [Take me to the next example &rarr;](../hello-name/)**
