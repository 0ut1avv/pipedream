Now that you've got the basics of workflow development, check out the rest of the docs to learn about Pipedream's advanced capabilities:


- Maintain state between workflow executions 
- Manage the execution rate and concurrency of workflow executions
- Trigger workflows with large data files up to 5TB
- Use a bastion host to connect to resources behind a firewall
- Work with the file system in Node.js 
- Develop custom sources and actions
- Contribute to the Pipedream registry

Also, be sure to check out the quickstarts for actions and sources (develop locally, push to Pipedream via CLI, and maintain your code in your own Github repo).

Finally, explore Pipedream's integrations marketplace, our open source registry of components on Github, and learn how you can contribute to the community!
